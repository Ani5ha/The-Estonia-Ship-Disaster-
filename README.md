When was the Sinking of the Estonia: September 28, 1994
Where was the Sinking of the Estonia: Near the Turku Archipelago, in the Baltic Sea
What was the Sinking of the Estonia death toll: 852 passengers and crew

Interesting things to investigate about the data:

Who's more likely to survive the sinking based on data?
Is age an indicator for survival?
Is gender an indicator for survival?
Did the crew aboard have a higher chance of survival than passengers?
